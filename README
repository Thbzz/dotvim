This is my vim configuration folder.
To benefit from it, you should place it in your home.
You just have to git clone this repo, rename the cloned
folder "dotvim" to ".vim" and finally add the three lines to 
your "~/.vimrc" file.
Be careful not to erase your existing configuration.

Instaling :

You should run:
cd
git clone git://github.com/Thbzz/dotvim.git
mv dotvim .vim
cat .vim/.vimrc >> .vimrc
cd .vim
git submodule init
git submodule update


The YouCompleteMe plugin requires a little more configuration.
You should have clang, cmake and python2.7 installed then run:

cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
./install.sh --clang-completer
